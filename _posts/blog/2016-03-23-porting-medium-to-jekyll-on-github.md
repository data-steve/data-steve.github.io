I’m porting my Medium page [<span class="__cf_email__"
data-cfemail="4f222a2b263a22612c2022600f2b2e3b2e">\[email protected\]</span>](http://medium.com/@data_steve)
\_steve to host on Github using Jekyll at
[data-steve.github.io](http://data-steve.github.io). I decided to do it
with code and make a package out of it in case others might want to.


#### Reasons 

R-bloggers does like Medium, since Medium will only share an excerpt of
the post with a link to the rest. R-bloggers wants the whole post. Fair
enough.

Its extra work, but I like the idea of being able to work within my own
development environment. And instead of having to learn a bunch of
keyboard shortcuts, I can write code and execute commands and push
updates via Jekyll.

#### Example 

Since I’m bothering to post this on Medium, I thought I’d get some use
out of it. I’ll show how I did it as a post on my new blog.

Here’s a code chunk to round out my porting example

``` 
# test code
nothing_special <- function(a){
    return(a)
}
```

Here’s a screenshot of a random bit of the code from the R package I’m
writing to show how the images are handled.
