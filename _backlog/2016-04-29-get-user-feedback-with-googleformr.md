#### useR feedback

As an R-dev, I'd like to know I'm meeting community need, as well as my own. But after an initial "aha!" moment, you don't always know how to live up to the full potential of what you've started with a package. [Even our beloved RStudio collects extensive data through their product to better understand how to build out the platform and offer other services.](https://www.rstudio.com/about/privacy-policy/)

So it'd be nice to have ways to allow meaningful useR feedback to be easily sent to me privately without a lot of hassle or clutter on either side. So, I decided to leverage ***googleformr*** to allow useRs to send comments directly from my packages.

#### gformr_comments

***googleformr*** now comes with the function `gformr_comments` function that allows any useR of ***googleformr*** to send ***useful, helpful, kind*** comments to a Google Form I have set up for this purpose.






feedbackr
The connection between R-Devs and useRs is a critical reason for R's success. The community has been fostered by an openness to share and collaborate towards greater quality.

useR groups and R-bloggers are invaluable tools for building community and set Rstats as an example to follow; but the average useR does not run a blog or have access to local or national meetups. Most do not have github accounts to post bug issues, or even may be intimidated by github's label as "Issues" Moreover, these are extra steps at the point
