#### gformr_comments

As an R-dev, I'd like to know I'm meeting community need, as well as my own. But after an initial "aha!" moment, you don't always know how to live up to the full potential of what you've started with a package.

So it'd be nice to have ways to allow meaningful useR feedback to be easily sent to me without a lot of hassle or clutter on either side. So, I decided to leverage `googleformr` to allow useRs to send comments directly from my packages.

`googleformr` now comes with the function `gformr_comments` function that allows any useR of `googleformr` to send ***useful, helpful, kind*** comments to a Google Form I have set up for this purpose. The function is avaiable on load of my package.

useR groups and R-bloggers are invaluable tools for building community and set Rstats as an example to follow; but the average useR does not run a blog or have access to local or national meetups.
